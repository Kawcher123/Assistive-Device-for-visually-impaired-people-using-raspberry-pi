# Assistive-Device-for-Visually-Impaired-People-Using-Raspberry-Pi
 (Final year project)
 
Assistive device for visually impaired people can improve mobility as well as the safety of them. This paper presents a smart guiding device that detects and localizes objects and yellow footway, and recognizes face of the known people. Then the information is sent to the visually impaired people by voice instruction. In addition, this device reads any printed text and converts it into speech. User can change the features using switches. The tracker app tracks the user. This device will assist the blind and partially sighted people in the known and unknown environment without the help of other persons.
